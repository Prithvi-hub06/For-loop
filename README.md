# For-loop
Here’s a version within 300 characters:  1. Use a for loop to roll a six-sided die 20+ times. Count how many times you roll 6, 1, and consecutive 6s. 2. Do 100 jumping jacks in sets of 10. After each set, ask "Are you tired?" If yes, ask to skip remaining sets and break, showing total completed. If no, continue and show remaining jacks.
